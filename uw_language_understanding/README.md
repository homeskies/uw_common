# uw_language_understanding

A ROS wrapper package for Nick Walker's [gpsr_command_understanding](https://github.com/nickswalker/gpsr-command-understanding) package. This code can take in commands in text form and map them to logical forms (default logical style comes with the package, but this can be customized by the application).
